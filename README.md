# PURPOSE:

This directory contains programs used to illustrate simple 
programming concepts in C.
The material here is meant to be used in conjunction with lectures in the class, not as stand alone teaching material.

In addition to the program files listed here there is also a SCRIPT/ directory. That contains a detailed description of the files and the order in which they can possibly be used in lectures.

Below we list files by topic:

##  TRIVIAL introductory stuff

* hello\_world.[ch] : A very trivial program with printf and include
* very\_first.c  : A first C program to look at - a bit about prints, also notion of data, instruction and control
* simple\_expressions.c  : A very trivial program with expressions include concept of blocks
* stats.c           : Compute trivial statistic, average, some other stuff
* input\_output.c : A description of the normal way to use scanf and printf
* limit\_explore.c : A simple exploration of integer number limits.
* first\_examples.c : A larger colleciton of simple explorations of the C language

### Understanding types:
conversions.c : print a character as integer and an integer as character etc.

* fillin\_simple.c : A bunch of programs to fill in.
* print\_next\_char.c : Notions of charaters as integers

## IF

* find\_max.c : A simple use of max to find the maximum of three numbers.
	Note the use of {} . Are they needed ?
	There are examples with and without parameters. The ones with parameters are useful during discussion
	on function parameter passing.

* list\_avg\_array.c : Read a list of numbers into an array and 
                       find the average.
* related\_arrays.c : Read two arrays (name[][] and scores) and search.
* apnf.c   : We write a sequence of funcitons illustrating how arrays 
		and pointers work in the context of function parameters.
